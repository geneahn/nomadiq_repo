The city is packed with historic sights that remind of those days, including medieval buildings, city gates and beautiful fountains.\\nToday, Aachen has become a pleasant mix of historic (often Baroque) grandeur and modern innovation. It has a population of 246,000 and is home to a large and highly regarded university. All in all, a place well worth visiting.\\nIn French (including crossborder train services from Brussels and Paris), the city is known as Aix-la-Chapelle, the city is called Aquisgr\\xc3\\xa1n in Spanish, whereas its Dutch name is Aken.</td>\n",

Due to the sulfur, the area will usually smell like rotten eggs. Locals and visitors drank the water for its healing powers.

Historically this spa-town was a prominent city, the place where the German Kings were crowned, and a famously favoured residence of Charlemagne who still lies buried in the impressive cathedral he himself had built. The city is packed with historic sights that remind of those days, including medieval buildings, city gates and beautiful fountains.\\nToday, Aachen has become a pleasant mix of historic (often Baroque) grandeur and modern innovation. It has a population of 246,000 and is home to a large and highly regarded university. All in all, a place well worth visiting.\\nIn French (including crossborder train services from Brussels and Paris), the city is known as Aix-la-Chapelle, the city is called Aquisgr\\xc3\\xa1n in Spanish, whereas its Dutch name is Aken.   \n",

Aachen has been known as a spa town for centuries. Hot water with a high level of sulfur (Kaiserwasser/Emperors Water) rises up in the city center and is brought to Elisenbrunnen in underground pipes. Due to the sulfur, the area will usually smell like rotten eggs. Locals and visitors drank the water for its healing powers. Recently, the water has been classified as a medical product that might only be prescribed by doctors, and thus the city was forced to put \"No Drinking Water\" signs on the fountains at Elisenbrunnen, although the water can still be drunk. &#160;edit\\nElisabethhalle (Historic public bath), Elisabethstra\\xc3\\x9fe 10, [3].

Around 800, the core building of the Palace Chapel was built.  During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Gothic choir (the \"Aachen glasshouse\"), the north and south chapel were added.  Through the centuries, many other constructions and decorations were completed.  Today, it is a unique and beautiful two-story cathedral of classical pillars, bronze railings, golden masterpieces, glassworks, etc.\\nThe cathedral is the memorial and funeral place of Charlemagne (+814). During 936-1531, 30 kings and 12 queens were anointed, crowned and enthroned here. During the Middle Ages, together with Jerusalem, Rome, and Santiago de Compostela, the Aachen Cathedral was one of Christendom\\'s most important venues for pilgrimage. Heiligtumsfahrt (the Aachen pilgrimage) has taken place every seven years since 1349. (The next one will take place in June 2021). In 1978, the Aachen Cathedral became the first German building to be inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \\n\\n  Town hall and cathedral in winter\\n Rathaus - The medieval town hall.

Therefore, we limit the vocabulary to the english dictionary and remove location-specific strings."
